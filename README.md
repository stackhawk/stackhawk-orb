# ðŸ¦… StackHawk CircleCI Orb

The CircleCI Orb [`stackhawk/stackhawk`](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/stackhawk/stackhawk) makes it easy to integrate StackHawk into your continuous integration pipeline.

## About StackHawk
[StackHawk](https://stackhawk.com) provides dynamic application vulnerability scanning from development to production.

  * âš¡ **Dynamic Application Scanning:** Use HawkScan to find and fix security bugs in your web apps, before you push to production. Think of it as security integration testing. [Get started](https://docs.stackhawk.com/hawkscan/getting-started.html) with your first scan in minutes.
  * ðŸ¦¸ **Built for Modern Dev Teams:** Automate scans with Docker commands, manage configs via YAML, and add app scanning as a build stage. We're built for dev teams that care about security and quality.
  * ðŸ§° **Vulnerability Management:** (coming soon!) Document for compliance. Prioritize and manage fixes with integrations to existing ticketing tools. Point in time assessments are a thing of the past - there is a better way.

Use the HawkScan command line tool to run application scans manually or through automation. Use the stackhawk/stackhawk Orb to make it simple to run it in CircleCI.

## Sign Up
To use this Orb, you must have a StackHawk API key. [Sign up](https://stackhawk.com) to get yours.

## Configure HawkScan
To scan your application, you will need a `stackhawk.yml` configuration file in your application source repository. [Read the docs](https://docs.stackhawk.com/) for more details.

## KAAKAWW!
That is all.
